	Troubleshooting Process
	The issue with the Redis-server is not starting checked with the (sudo systemctl status redis) command the error is advanced data-store is not able to start tried with changing the configuration file in (/etc/redis/redis.conf, /etc/systemd/system/redis.service) reloaded the daemon, tried to start the redis again but server not started, then check the issue with the command (journalctl -xe) it shows the permissions error for the folder and gave the permission, restarted the redis-server then working fine.

	Steps:
	1. The solution for the Redis-server is not starting seems that redis folder should have a execute permission at parent dir. Then provided the execute permission(chmod +x /var/log/) then reload the daemon(systemctl daemon-reload), restarted the redis-server(sudo systemctl restart redis), checked the status of the redis service(sudo systemctl status redis) and it is working fine.

	2.The alternate solution for this issue which is manually need to run the command given(/usr/local/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf) at everytime restart of the machine.
